This assignment is designed to provide me and your colleagues with information about you, the participants in this class, and what you hope to learn this quarter. At our next class on Wednesday January 14 we’ll be discussing your answers to the questions below.

Oral presentation (4-5 minutes) of response to Q1-5 in class on Wednesday January 14. Submit here (or send me by email) your presentation slides by noon on Wednesday January 14. 

1. Please describe your experiences in statistics, linear algebra, optimization, and differential equations. What classes at GTech have you taken on these topics, if any?

2. Have you taken a class in inverse theory before? If yes, was it based on a specific textbook? Please tell us the author and title.

3. Do you have a preferred programming language for doing homework problems? What do you like about it?

4. What kind of data are you interested in? Please provide an example of a geophysical problem you have either encountered during your studies or are interested in solving. In the context of this class, that first requires an idea of how to represent some Earth property and predict observables if you know that property exactly (the forward model). The inverse problem is to recover estimates of the property from a finite number of observations plus noise, and quantify the uncertainty in your result.

5. What do you hope to learn from this class?
